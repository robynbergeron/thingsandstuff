Thank you for being a maintainer of one of the modules in ansible-modules-extras! This guide provides module maintainers an overview of their responsibilities, resources for additional information, and links to helpful tools.

In addition to the information below, module maintainers should be familiar with:
* Documentation on module development (http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/developing_modules.html)
* General Ansible community development practices http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/community.html

''Maintainer Responsibilities''

When you contribute a new module to the ansible-modules-extras repository, you become the maintainer for that module once it has been merged. Maintainership empowers you with the authority to accept, reject, or request revisions to pull requests on your module -- but as they say, "with great power comes great responsibility."

Maintainers of Ansible modules are expected to provide feedback, responses, or actions on pull requests or issues to the module(s) they maintain in a reasonably timely manner.

The Ansible community hopes that you will find that maintaining your module is as rewarding for you as having the module is for the wider community.

Pull Requests and Issues

Pull Requests:

Module pull requests are located in the ansible-modules-extras repository (link).

Because of the high volume of pull requests, notification of PRs to specific modules are routed by an automated bot to the appropriate maintainer for handling. It is recommended that you set an appropriate notification process to receive notifications which mention your GitHub ID.

Issues:

Issues for modules, including bug reports, documentation bug reports, and feature requests, are tracked in the ansible-modules-extras repository. (link)

At this time, we do not have an automated process by which Issues are handled. If you are a maintainer of a specific module, it is recommended that you periodically search module issues for issues which mention your module's name (or some varition on that name), as well as setting an appropriate notification process for receiving notification of mentions of your GitHub ID.
